            Good morning sir/madam.

            Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
            
            My name is Vadthyavath Chandulal. I'm basically from Telangana and currently staying in Hyderabad,

            Being a fresher I'm very adaptable and always keen to learn new things. 
            
            This is a valuable quality that I'll bring to the table. It's a good 
            
            platform to showcase my skills and I'm confident about making a good 
            
            impact in your organization. As a fresher, I'll give my full potential 
            
            to contribute to the growth of this company and try to become an asset to 
            
            the company.

            <pre style="font-style: italic;" id="pre">

            As I mentioned earlier, I am a fast learner and a hardworking person.

            Apart from this, I am an extrovert person and honest which I think every 
            
            organisation wants its workers to be.
            
            These are my strengths.
            
            If I talk about my weaknesses then my only weakness is my clothing because 
            
            I like to wear traditional clothes instead of modern that's why most people 
            
            judge me just from my looks no one sees my qualities.

        <pre style="font-style: italic;" id="pre">
            
            As a fresher, I am looking for a company, where I can apply the knowledge, my skills,
            
            and insights that, I have gained during my college days. Your company is well-known 
            
            that promoting and allowing young minds to grow with a supportive back and encouraging push. 
            
            Furthermore, it has different working positions which match my abilities and interests, so, 
            
            I see a good career start in your company where I will work passionately and with great sincerity.

        <h6>
        <pre style="font-style: italic;" id="pre">

            Hard work is about putting in more effort and strengths.

            On the opposite side, there are less efforts in smart work but results can be beneficial for both 
            
            the hard work and smart work.

            For instance.

            We can make a paper map which needs a lot of hard work for drawing it properly which is called hard work
            
            but on the other side, we can use google map just by operating our phone which is called smart work.

        <pre style="font-style: italic;" id="pre">
          
            It totally depends on the situation but more preferably I will find out the other solution to the problem
            
            which is beneficial for me and my company as well instead of speaking lie. Because every problem has a 
            
            solution.

            Assume that, if I will lie for the company but sooner or later one-day truth will reveal then the 
            
            reputation of my company will be disputed.
